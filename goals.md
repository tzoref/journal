# Goals

1. extend **text analysis** of gendered terms in the Psalms of Solomon that I began last semester in Computational Linguistics Methods 1.
2. use CollateX or similar software to generate a **critical apparatus** of manuscripts with variantsâ€”for possible capstone project: digital edition of chapter 1 of the Tosefta.
3. map out a **plan** for continuing tech learning after the end of this course

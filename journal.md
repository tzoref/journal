# JOURNAL 

# Week 1 for Week 2

5 February, 2020 LAB JOURNAL WEEK 1

Plans/Goals 
1. command-line: 
1.1	to try to locate/recover the “projects” folder that I had created during the GC Institute, but lost when I tried to move it in class
1.2	 practice
2. to read the syllabus and other course materials and select further hands-on activity


**1st hour** (Friday 31 January) 
set-up and orientation. 
I started a word document to plan my course goals; and my plans for praxis and journal entry; and to review course materials. I cut and pasted the syllabus into the word document, along with notes I’d jotted down in gmail during our class session. Word and Gmail are my “comfort” media—I look forward to moving beyond these. 

Note: I was trying to do this work on the sofa in the room of my mother’s room in an assisted-living facility to which she moved last week. This proved challenging, especially since I interrupted my hour, when my sister called to discuss options for my mother’s living arrangements and care. My focus was poor when I resumed my work.

**2nd hour (Sunday 2 February)**
Reviewed: DHRI Command Line tutorial 
[Note: I allowed myself the luxury of following the link to Drucker, since I learned a lot from readings by her assigned last semester, in Intro and Text Analysis courses. But this led to a distraction. I paused my work to compose this facebook post:
“My Digital Humanities studies will often raise painful reminders and references to Biblical and Jewish studies, but occasionally there are delightful intersections:
https://genius.com/Johanna-drucker-from-a-to-screen-annotat…. Fun to see Johanna Drucker make good use of Seth Larkin Sanders' Invention of Hebrew. (+ secondarily-- as I set aside my witnessing of the disintegration of the facade and bulwark of US liberal democracy, to work on this assignment, and even enjoy it-- I'm aware of a shared grappling with the need to continue some business-as-usual in order to exercise the ability and power to make any sort of difference).” ]
I also used a combination of command-line and “Finder” GUI to make sure I have only 1 “projects” directory, and it is in my desktop. It contains a “cheat_sheet” directory, with 2 files: cheat-sheet.txt and cheat-sheet.md.
I then cleared up my computer by deleting files and directories I no longer need, including from the GC DRI. I did this from GUI because I was scared of deleting core directories. My computer is running faster now, and my directories feel like less of a mysterious mess. 
**3rd - 4th hour**
The ‘code’ command was not working from bash.  I tried to problem-solve, searching the web for ideas; but in the end uninstalled and reinstalled through Anaconda in GUI. 
I proceeded to the “pipe” lesson.
When I saw “Download nypl_items.csv”, I mistakenly tried typing this in as a command in bash.  Getting “command not found” error, I spent over an hour deleting python and anaconda files from my laptop.  And again, re-installed Anaconda.  This time, when the download command did not work, I decided to think instead of rushing to act. And realized that “Download nypl_items.csv” was presented as a link.  So, I clicked … and the file downloaded. 

**5th hour**
More command line practice with Learn Python the Hard Way (Command Line Crash Course (from Learn Python the Hard Way)), reviewing pwd, ls, cd, mkdir, and rmdir.  I stopped at new material: push and pop.
[Note: There is a lot about I like about the method of Learn Python the Hard Way, but I dislike the aggressive “bro”-tone. (I would like to read the article by Wendy Hui Kyong Chun, that was mentioned in The Command Line tutorial: "On Software, or the Persistence of Visual Knowledge" (2004)).

I would like to keep a To Do (/To Read) list from the course, maybe in my journal.]

I started following along in Programming Historian (Programming Historian Command Line tutorial), using man (for manual); but lacked confidence to try using wget or downloading text to continue the exercise.

**6th hour** 
I started running through DHRI Git tutorial but felt overwhelmed. I did this tutorial in the GC DRI, but still, I felt that I’d come up against some kind of limit of absorption. 
I set a new goal: to design some kind of visual as a mnemonic for the Agile Manifesto points. 
I searched the web for “mindmapping tool open resource” and from a 2013 list on mashable, I chose xmind….  But when I opened it, after downloading, I again felt overwhelmed; still facing a wall. I created some mnemonic icons in Word with clipart, to help me remember:
Individuals and interactions over processes and tools
Working software over comprehensive documentation
Customer collaboration over contract negotiation
Responding to change over following a plan

# WEEK 2 for WEEK 3
**PLAN**
From Patricks's mail, annotated: 
1. Reinforce **command line** skills.
NOTE:I feel comfortable with basics of command line. I think I can progress with this via natural use rather than drill
2. Create a **journal.md file** in journal folder and start tracking hours in there, using markdown headings to keep the weeks separate.
**learn how to make unordered lists in markdown to help structure the file.** 
3. For journal updtaes: continually add, commit, and push to **GitHub**.
4. **Python**. maybe with Learn Python 3 the Hard Way. 

**HOUR 1**

created the journal.md file from the command line.  inserted last week's hours and set up for this week.
staged, committed, and pushed the journal markdown file.
started working with Python: https://github.com/GC-DRI/python/blob/master/sections/repl.md.  I had done this in the DRI, and am familiar with the concepts from Comp. Ling. Methods course.  Finally, now, I "grok" it.  I stopped at "input", having reached limit. would like to resume here, next praxis:
https://github.com/GC-DRI/python/blob/master/sections/input.md
and to try: https://runestone.academy/runestone/books/published/thinkcspy/index.html How to Think Like a Computer Scientist: Interactive Edition.  signed up for this

**HOUR 2**
I looked at unordered lists, but I do not really understand how that will work in a file, where I'll certainly want to have listed items.  I prefer to use a ## hash heading for now.
worked with runestone.academy.
**note: When reading or writing code, say to yourself “n is assigned 17” or “n gets the value 17”** or “n is a reference to the object 17” or “n refers to the object 17”. Don’t say “n equals 17”.

**HOURS 3 and 4**
runestone.academy ch. 2, variables; and beginning of ch. 3, Debugging

** WEEK of FEB 10:  SICK **

**HOURS 5 & 6**
chs. 4 & 5 runestone.academy Python Turtle Graphics
i followed the learning modules, but when I tried to do the exercises at the end of chapter 4, i realized i had not internalized the steps of the procedure. I proceeded to ch. 5. I will try in my next session to toggle back and forth between exercises and the learning modules. 

**HOUR 7**
returned to the lab resources for Week 2 on course syllabus https://github.com/smythp/software-design-lab (following Elena's suggestion)
I think i have gotten what i can out of runestone.academy.
A lot of my lab time got spent on reading instead of doing-- my frequent crutch.
But I did spend around a half hour playing in a markdown document in vscode, which i created using the command line (and checked with cat command; markdown_tutorial.md)

# WEEK 3

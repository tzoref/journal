# JOURNAL 

# Week 1 for Week 2

5 February, 2020 LAB JOURNAL WEEK 1

Plans/Goals 
1. command-line: 
1.1	to try to locate/recover the “projects” folder that I had created during the GC Institute, but lost when I tried to move it in class
1.2	 practice
2. to read the syllabus and other course materials and select further hands-on activity


**1st hour** (Friday 31 January) 
set-up and orientation. 
I started a word document to plan my course goals; and my plans for praxis and journal entry; and to review course materials. I cut and pasted the syllabus into the word document, along with notes I’d jotted down in gmail during our class session. Word and Gmail are my “comfort” media—I look forward to moving beyond these. 

Note: I was trying to do this work on the sofa in the room of my mother’s room in an assisted-living facility to which she moved last week. This proved challenging, especially since I interrupted my hour, when my sister called to discuss options for my mother’s living arrangements and care. My focus was poor when I resumed my work.

**2nd hour (Sunday 2 February)**
Reviewed: DHRI Command Line tutorial 
[Note: I allowed myself the luxury of following the link to Drucker, since I learned a lot from readings by her assigned last semester, in Intro and Text Analysis courses. But this led to a distraction. I paused my work to compose this facebook post:
“My Digital Humanities studies will often raise painful reminders and references to Biblical and Jewish studies, but occasionally there are delightful intersections:
https://genius.com/Johanna-drucker-from-a-to-screen-annotat…. Fun to see Johanna Drucker make good use of Seth Larkin Sanders' Invention of Hebrew. (+ secondarily-- as I set aside my witnessing of the disintegration of the facade and bulwark of US liberal democracy, to work on this assignment, and even enjoy it-- I'm aware of a shared grappling with the need to continue some business-as-usual in order to exercise the ability and power to make any sort of difference).” ]
I also used a combination of command-line and “Finder” GUI to make sure I have only 1 “projects” directory, and it is in my desktop. It contains a “cheat_sheet” directory, with 2 files: cheat-sheet.txt and cheat-sheet.md.
I then cleared up my computer by deleting files and directories I no longer need, including from the GC DRI. I did this from GUI because I was scared of deleting core directories. My computer is running faster now, and my directories feel like less of a mysterious mess. 
**3rd - 4th hour**
The ‘code’ command was not working from bash.  I tried to problem-solve, searching the web for ideas; but in the end uninstalled and reinstalled through Anaconda in GUI. 
I proceeded to the “pipe” lesson.
When I saw “Download nypl_items.csv”, I mistakenly tried typing this in as a command in bash.  Getting “command not found” error, I spent over an hour deleting python and anaconda files from my laptop.  And again, re-installed Anaconda.  This time, when the download command did not work, I decided to think instead of rushing to act. And realized that “Download nypl_items.csv” was presented as a link.  So, I clicked … and the file downloaded. 

**5th hour**
More command line practice with Learn Python the Hard Way (Command Line Crash Course (from Learn Python the Hard Way)), reviewing pwd, ls, cd, mkdir, and rmdir.  I stopped at new material: push and pop.
[Note: There is a lot about I like about the method of Learn Python the Hard Way, but I dislike the aggressive “bro”-tone. (I would like to read the article by Wendy Hui Kyong Chun, that was mentioned in The Command Line tutorial: "On Software, or the Persistence of Visual Knowledge" (2004)).

I would like to keep a To Do (/To Read) list from the course, maybe in my journal.]

I started following along in Programming Historian (Programming Historian Command Line tutorial), using man (for manual); but lacked confidence to try using wget or downloading text to continue the exercise.

**6th hour** 
I started running through DHRI Git tutorial but felt overwhelmed. I did this tutorial in the GC DRI, but still, I felt that I’d come up against some kind of limit of absorption. 
I set a new goal: to design some kind of visual as a mnemonic for the Agile Manifesto points. 
I searched the web for “mindmapping tool open resource” and from a 2013 list on mashable, I chose xmind….  But when I opened it, after downloading, I again felt overwhelmed; still facing a wall. I created some mnemonic icons in Word with clipart, to help me remember:
Individuals and interactions over processes and tools
Working software over comprehensive documentation
Customer collaboration over contract negotiation
Responding to change over following a plan

# WEEKS 2 & 3
**PLAN**
From Patricks's mail, annotated: 
1. Reinforce **command line** skills.
NOTE:I feel comfortable with basics of command line. I think I can progress with this via natural use rather than drill
2. Create a **journal.md file** in journal folder and start tracking hours in there, using markdown headings to keep the weeks separate.
**learn how to make unordered lists in markdown to help structure the file.** 
3. For journal updtaes: continually add, commit, and push to **GitHub**.
4. **Python**. maybe with Learn Python 3 the Hard Way. 

**HOUR 1**

created the journal.md file from the command line.  inserted last week's hours and set up for this week.
staged, committed, and pushed the journal markdown file.
started working with Python: https://github.com/GC-DRI/python/blob/master/sections/repl.md.  I had done this in the DRI, and am familiar with the concepts from Comp. Ling. Methods course.  Finally, now, I "grok" it.  I stopped at "input", having reached limit. would like to resume here, next praxis:
https://github.com/GC-DRI/python/blob/master/sections/input.md
and to try: https://runestone.academy/runestone/books/published/thinkcspy/index.html How to Think Like a Computer Scientist: Interactive Edition.  signed up for this

**HOUR 2**
I looked at unordered lists, but I do not really understand how that will work in a file, where I'll certainly want to have listed items.  I prefer to use a ## hash heading for now.
worked with runestone.academy.
**note: When reading or writing code, say to yourself “n is assigned 17” or “n gets the value 17”** or “n is a reference to the object 17” or “n refers to the object 17”. Don’t say “n equals 17”.

**HOURS 3 and 4**
runestone.academy ch. 2, variables; and beginning of ch. 3, Debugging

** WEEK of FEB 10:  SICK **

**HOURS 5 & 6**
chs. 4 & 5 runestone.academy Python Turtle Graphics
i followed the learning modules, but when I tried to do the exercises at the end of chapter 4, i realized i had not internalized the steps of the procedure. I proceeded to ch. 5. I will try in my next session to toggle back and forth between exercises and the learning modules. 

**HOUR 7**
returned to the lab resources for Week 2 on course syllabus https://github.com/smythp/software-design-lab (following Elena's suggestion)
I think i have gotten what i can out of runestone.academy.
A lot of my lab time got spent on reading instead of doing-- my frequent crutch.
But I did spend around a half hour playing in a markdown document in vscode, which i created using the command line (and checked with cat command; markdown_tutorial.md)

# WEEK 4 
# HOUR 1 
# 21 February
Python Programming/Creating Python Programs
exercise 1 - 4 in https://learnpythonthehardway.org/book/ (despite my objections to the discourse form)

# HOUR 2
# 23 February
exercises 5-10 in Learn Python the Hard Way

# HOUR 3
exercises 11-15 in Learn Python the Hard Way.  Had trouble with ex. 15.  i need to fill in some gap about working with command line in python. 

# HOUR 4
# 24 February 
exercises 15-16.  only did 40 minutes

# HOUR 5
# 26 February
exercise 17 in Learn Python the Hard Way, to complete "Hour 4"
nearly completed part 1 of Django tutorial, though I'm not sure I got it all right:
https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.0/intro/tutorial01/ .
When I finish this, I might try part 2 of the tutorial, or try to follow this video:
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UmljXZIypDc&fbclid=IwAR1PXZB6oCragUlCHXojvE21rE4rBQZlgc0YV25k6uPHbkzDRN0QfJwlH1Y
Python Django Tutorial: Full-Featured Web App Part 1 - Getting Started


# WEEK 5
(Did not track lab hours: Personal issues-- Family Quarantined due to COVID-19 exposure etc.)

# WEEK 6
# HOUR 1
installed Jekyl (including overcoming some glitches. that felt really good-- not to give up in the face of errors, but to search solutions online--and find and implement them).
HTML , using https://www.w3schools.com/html/html_intro.asp, at first in the editor provided with the tutorial, then shifted to VSCode. Got through basics, started "elements".

# HOUR 2
Javascript with http://jsforcats.com/

# QUESTIONS: #   
1. The tutorial states: "All HTML documents must start with a document type declaration: <!DOCTYPE html>." But we did not do this in our in-class exercise with the sloths?
2. I can't insert images. I do not understand how to access an image or write the proper code.  But even when I used the image from the w3schools, it did not work. 

# WEEK 7
# HOUR 1
Khan academy HTML.  I understand a bit more about inserting images in HTML

# HOURS 2 & 3
Khan academy general programming review

# HOURS 4, 5, 6, 7
HTML with W3schools https://www.w3schools.com/html/html_intro.asp: Elements, Attributes (href for links, with <a> tag; src for images with <img> tag; style; lang, title for tooltip), Headings, Paragraphs, Styles, Formatting, and some of Quotations (up to abbreviations).

# QUESTIONS: #   
1. The tutorial states: "All HTML documents must start with a document type declaration: <!DOCTYPE html>." But we did not do this in our in-class exercise with the sloths?
2. I still can't insert images. I do not understand how to access an image or write the proper code. I get that I need to move it into the program's folder, but still don't get how. 
3. I do not understand the difference between <b> bold and <strong> strong? and between <i> italics and <em> emphasis?

# HOUR 8
more HTML and some CSS with W3schools.  I think I'm saturated with this for now.

# HOUR 9
An Introduction to Programming Paradigms: https://digitalfellows.commons.gc.cuny.edu/2018/03/12/an-introduction-to-programming-paradigms/.  Imperative; stepped through Functional via copy & paste.  Need to spend more time with both. Maybe with Python the Hard Way?

# HOUR 10

I am at a wall with the programming paradigms.  Hope to push through it with class time. 
for now, back to Python the Hard Way.
.

# MARCH 25
Still at a wall.  
It's not just COVID-19.  It's that I can't teach myself coding. I've tried in the past, and it's just not something I can do on my own. I can only do this "in community".  I tried joining Monday evening's session to re-connect, but could not stay. I hope that our class this evening will restore the framework that I need to do this independent work. 

# MARCH 26
# HOUR 1
SQL with W3schools, up to Null Values https://www.w3schools.com/sql/sql_null_values.asp
reading: https://github.com/DHRI-Curriculum/databases

# HOUR 2
SQL with W3schools, completed

# HOUR 3, 4...
(I started this at 10 AM, and it's now 3 PM.  my "1-2" hours of undisturbed coding has been interrupted by conversations with family, friends, colleagues, cooking, eating. i wonder what my longest stretch of work was. I think tomorrow I will aim for 15 minute intervals.  or at least 1)
SQL from DHRI, up to here:
https://github.com/DHRI-Curriculum/databases/blob/master/sections/8-innerjoin.md

# HOUR 5
SQL from DHRI.  But cannot download nypl_data/nypl_items.csv (MESSAGE: "Sorry about that, but we can't show files that are this big right now.)

# HOUR 6
some more SQL from DHRI, but mostly practice with GITHUB and terminal in trying to get the .csv file and move it around.
and trying, unsuccessfully, to troubleshoot for this error when trying to import pandas:
INTEL MKL ERROR: dlopen(/Users/shanitzoref/opt/anaconda3/lib/libmkl_core.dylib, 9): image not found.
Intel MKL FATAL ERROR: Cannot load libmkl_core.dylib.

# HOURS 1-5
Task 3 (Mid-point Karel) https://compedu.stanford.edu/codeinplace/v1/#/handout/Assignment1.pdf


APRIL 23
# HOUR 1
python practice (stanford course, assignment 2)

# HOUR 2
created a final_project directory, and saved the json text of my text (tractate Berakhot) into the file.
created a json_Berakhot.py file to call this json text.
I've not succeeded in uploading these to github

# HOUR 3
uploaded files to github by initializing a new depository and changing the name of the json file.

# HOUR 4
python practice (stanford course, assignment 2)

# HOUR 5
SQL:
I cannot afford to purchase SQL the Hard Way, and probably would not want to in any case.
I scored 76% on the quiz, W3Schools-- covering the material in the tutorial i did at the end of march.
Clearly i need further review, but I don't think I'll get a good return on doing W3 over again.
Repeating DHRI Session on Databases is proving worthwhile. I got up to https://github.com/DHRI-Curriculum/databases/blob/master/sections/9-importcsv.md "Import data into table"

# HOUR 6
SQL DHRI, up to https://github.com/DHRI-Curriculum/databases/blob/master/sections/11-querieschallenge.md
(NOTE:  having done this in advance made it a lot less stressful to follow the SQL session, wed. night's class)

APRIL 30
# HOUR 1
interacting with json Berakhot
python practice

# HOUR 2
flask https://programminghistorian.org/en/lessons/creating-apis-with-python-and-flask#implementing-our-api

# HOUR 3
python practice (stanford course: functions, parameters)
attempt to map out final project:

* *LONG-TERM GOAL*
to create a database with information about the 13 traditional "hermeneutical principles" used in the Talmud and related rabbinic writings. 
* *MID-RANGE GOAL*
to catalogue and compare Talmudic occurrences of the "a fortiori" argument, a form of analogical reasoning, arguing from a mild case to a more severe case.  These instances are marked by technical terms, such as "qal va'chomer", "eino din", and "al achat kama ve'chama" (conventionally translated into English as: "a fortiori", "is it not clear from comparison", "all the more so".)
* *COURSE PROJECT GOAL*
to search for instances of this argument by means of the expressions "qal va'chomer" and "eino din" and "al achat kama ve'chama" in the first "tractate" of the Babylonian Talmud-- "Berakhot" (English: "Blessings").

STEPS: 
1. DOWNLOAD the JSON code for the Aramaic text of tractate Berakhot from the open source website www.sefaria.org: Berakhot_sefaria.json
2. CREATE a file to get the data into python: json_Berakhot.py
3. CREATE a TEXT FILE containing the text in a non-nested form.
4. SEARCH for the desired terms and print out the occurrences: either marked by surrounding words or some other way of identifying location.  including page number.

# HOUR 4 & HOUR 5
puzzling over how to convert json file to text file.
colleague recommended https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9N6a-VLBa2I&feature=youtu.be&t=530&fbclid=IwAR3unxux7O5ZLaaJ1f4fbdqahiuHw9dnbSDIbtDCYYHNx3hBLBm8TLdMyHg

python review and practice: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYXdXT2l-Gg&list=PL-osiE80TeTt2d9bfVyTiXJA-UTHn6WwU (through Lesson 5, Dictionaries)

# HOUR 6
python review and practice: Corey Schafer videos, from 6: Working with Key Values; Conditionals & Booleans; Loops and Iterations; Functions ("keeping code dry"-- using variables & functions)
Did some more poking around the Berakhot json file, attempting to be more comprehensive.
I realized that the words are all backwards when I print out text by running the python file.
The original json file is fine, where the text is separated into a series of strings.  
I see that "line" is one of the elements in the dictionary key "sectionNames", but i don't know if the strings correspond to lines, or how to make this information work for me if it is the case.

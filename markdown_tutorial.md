# Section 1

## Subsection 1.1

Lorem impsum dolor sit amet,  consectetur adipisicing elit, sed do eiusmod tempor incididunt ut labore et dolore magna aliqua. Ut enim ad minim veniam, quis nostrud exercitation ullamco laboris nisi ut aliquip ex ea commodo consequat.

Next paragraph should start like this. Do not indent.

## Subsection 1.2

Sed ut perspiciatus unde omnis iste natus error sit voluptatem accusantium doloremque laudantium, totam rem aperiam, eaque  ipsa quae ab illo inventore veritatis et quasi architecto beatae vitae dicta sunt explicabo.

# Section 2

## Subsection 2.1

This is the dummy text that I am adding for subsection 2.1.

To start a new paragraph i left a blank line, with no indentation.

And here is a third paragraph to get the hang of things.  And also i want to make it longer than one line so it feels a bit more realistic for how i would really write.  Would I really produce text in markdown?  I guess i need to keep an open mind and start by doing the exercises and then i'll know better.  I certainly want practice, for text editing and maybe also for my ambiguities platform, or resource or whatever it will be. At least i will probably want it for the database itself, if not the front end user interface.  yes, i know, i do not necessarily want that distinction to be so sharp.  Memories of SQE. *ouch*

# Section 3

## Subsection 3.1

I see that there is only a preceding hash or double hash, not a surrounding bracket as for the asterisks.

Typing this just to have a second paragraph.

## Subsection 3.2

And again, dummy text for the practice. A sentence that needs a note.[^1].  That was pasted from the tutorial. Now I will try my own.[^2]. But I do not know how to add a link.  Or an emoticon to show frown.

         p> <br></br>REGINA JONAS was largely forgotten by the world until the 1990s, when her files were discoverd in an obscure archive in East Berlin. We now know that Regina Jonas was born in Berlin on August 3, 1902, to Sarah and Wolf Jonas. She attended the Rykestraße synagogue’s Jüdische Mädchen Mittelschule (Jewish Girls School). Dr. Max Weyl, the head of the synagogue, became Regina's private tutor and mentor.<br></br> After receiving her teacher's degree in 1923, Jonas began advanced Jewish studies at the Hochschule für die Wissenschaft des Judentums. The Hochshule permitted women to undertake the curriculum of rabbinical studies, though it did not ordain women. In 1930, Jonas presented her final 88-page treatise. It's title:"Can a Woman Be a Rabbi According to Halachic Sources?"<br></br>The Hochshule awarded Jonas's well-argued thesis a grade of "good", but it would not grant ordination to a woman. Jonas devoted herself to community service, without the title of rabbi, and without the opportunity to obtain a rabbinical pulpit. In 1935, she finally received a rabbinical diploma, from the liberal Rabbi Max Dienemann in Offenbach. She continued chaplaincy work in Berlin, including teaching and holding prayer services, under the increasingly harsh Nazi regime, even after being forced into labor by the Nazis.<br></br>In 1942, Jonas was deported to the Theresienstadt concentration camp, where she continued her rabbinical work, including assisting noted psychologist Viktor Frankl in a suicide prevention program, and giving lectures on a range of topics including power, ethics, and ego.<br></br>Regina Jonas was murdered in Auschwitz in October 1944.<br></br>The story of the recovery of Regina Jonas's story, and of the revival of her memory and appreciation of her legacy, is of interest in its own right.
